## 🚀 Getting Started

You can run this application in two ways: using Docker (recommended for ease of use) or setting it up locally for development.

### Method 1: Running with Docker (Recommended)

This is the simplest way to run the application.

**Prerequisites:**
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running

**Instructions:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vipul-space23/Quiz-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Quiz-Recommendation-System
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**
   This command will install all dependencies and train the AI models inside the container. This step can take a few minutes on the first run.
   ```bash
   docker build -t quiz-app .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8501:8501 quiz-app
   ```

4. **Open the app:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

### Method 2: Local Development Setup (Without Docker)

Use this method if you want to modify the code or contribute to development.

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager
- A virtual environment tool (like `venv`)

**Instructions:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vipul-space23/Quiz-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Quiz-Recommendation-System
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   # For Windows
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

   # For macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Train the AI Models (One-Time Step):**
   Before running the app for the first time, you must train the models:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
   This will create the `models/` directory and save the trained model files.

5. **Run the Streamlit App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

6. **Open the app:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## 📋 Dataset Format

Your `dataset.csv` must contain the following columns:

```csv
id,topic,difficulty,question,option_a,option_b,option_c,option_d,answer,explanation
1,Python,easy,What is Python?,A programming language,A snake,A movie,A game,a,Python is a high-level programming language...
```

### Required Columns:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each question
- `topic`: Subject category (e.g., "Python", "Algorithms", "Machine Learning")
- `difficulty`: Question difficulty ("easy", "medium", "hard")
- `question`: The question text
- `option_a`, `option_b`, `option_c`, `option_d`: Multiple choice options
- `answer`: Correct answer ("a", "b", "c", or "d")
- `explanation`: Detailed explanation of the correct answer

## ⚙️ How the Recommendation Engine Works

The core of the application is the adaptive recommendation logic found in `quiz_logic.py`. It follows an intelligent rule-based system that analyzes user performance patterns:

### Adaptive Logic Based on Performance:

1. **Struggling Learners (<40% accuracy):**
   - Recommends **easy** difficulty on the **same topic**
   - **Reduces question count** to build confidence
   - If consecutive struggles occur, further reduces quiz size
   - May switch to user's best-performing topic for confidence building

2. **Moderate Performers (40%-70% accuracy):**
   - Progresses to **medium** difficulty level
   - **Increases question count** to solidify knowledge
   - Provides steady skill reinforcement

3. **Advanced Learners (>70% accuracy):**
   - **Increases difficulty level** (easy → medium → hard)
   - **Increases question count** for comprehensive testing
   - Upon mastering hard topics, recommends **related new topics** using the topic relationship map

### ML-Powered Insights:

The system uses trained machine learning models to classify users into learning profiles:

- **Learner Type Classification:**
  - Advanced: High accuracy, consistent performance
  - Moderate: Steady progress, good retention
  - Struggling: Needs more practice, benefits from easier questions
  - Balanced: Adapts well to different difficulty levels

- **Engagement Analysis:**
  - High: Quick response times, consistent participation
  - Medium: Regular engagement with some variation
  - Low: Irregular patterns, may need motivation
